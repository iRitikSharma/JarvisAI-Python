# 🧠 JarvisAI (Python)

A voice‑controlled AI assistant built in Python that listens to your voice commands and performs useful tasks like opening websites, searching information, playing media, telling time, and more — just like Jarvis from the movies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- 🗣️ Voice output (text‑to‑speech)  
- 📂 Open applications and websites  
- 🔍 Web search and Wikipedia lookup  
- 📺 Play YouTube videos  
- ⏰ Tell current time  
- ✉️ Send emails via voice

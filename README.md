"Jarvis AI: A Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant Powered by OpenAI"
This Python-based virtual assistant mimics the functionality of an AI-powered personal assistant. It leverages voice recognition, text-to-speech, and OpenAI's GPT-3 to provide intelligent and conversational interactions. Key features include:

Voice Commands: Accepts voice input using speech_recognition and performs tasks based on user queries.
Web Browsing: Opens popular websites like YouTube, Wikipedia, and Google with simple commands.
AI-Powered Chat: Engages in natural language conversations using OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model.
Media Playback: Plays music or specific files stored locally.
Time Updates: Provides the current time in a user-friendly format.
Text-to-Speech: Uses pyttsx3 for clear, human-like responses.
Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors during voice recognition or API calls.
Modular Design: Features extensible and platform-specific configurations, such as file paths for Windows.
This project offers a customizable and scalable foundation for building a robust, AI-powered virtual assistant. Perfect for learning about AI integration, voice processing, and Python automation.
